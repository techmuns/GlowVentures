# Stage history — continuation

### Stage 10fs — COMPLETE COST RECOVERY FOR LIVE FUND HOLDINGS

- The second audit found that Stage 10fn covered quote-only shares but omitted the analogous fund overlays. Exact owner, scheme/plan, dated units and FIFO now recover 21 more valued fund/account costs and three recorded DSP ETF costs. Twenty valued rows support HPR; ICICI Equity Savings recovers cost only because its sale proceeds have an inconsistent cash sign. Individual and pooled return paths withhold that unverified HPR. No layout, controls or styles change. Automated review also caught an aggregate path excluding the unknown-proceeds holding: Return Analysis now keeps it in the FIFO pool and withholds the pooled return. Existing absence helpers name the actual proceeds gap.
- A Closing ends a review folio block. Ajay's 34,045.997 Kotak Large & Mid Cap units must not be pooled with the separate, already-costed 27,900.484-unit AMC folio. Unmatched plans, later movements and even the 0.066-unit Motilal Arbitrage discrepancy refuse recovery.
- The exact client request now includes residual fund balances, Hope's printed-cost/available-unit disagreement and the ESDS register's 42-share bridge and ₹774 rate/payment difference. The four-page HDFC scan was visually read: it has quantities, not acquisition costs. Existing source files are not requested again as though absent.
- Tests cover separate/ambiguous folios, original FIFO lots, wrong-sign proceeds, exact-unit refusals and recovered costs reaching both fund overlays. Full source regeneration and financial CI verify reproducibility; source-row evidence stays beside every recovery.

### Stage 10ft — NAME UNVERIFIED SALE PROCEEDS ON THE HOME GAIN CARD

- Production verification of Stage 10fs found that the home Gain / loss card correctly withheld the unknown aggregate but called it missing cost. It now names unverified sale proceeds and carries the source-row reason into the existing calculation and hover. A separately measured private gain cannot replace an explicitly unverified book gain. No layout or controls change.

### Stage 10fu — RECOVER WHEN AN OPEN TAB REQUESTS AN OLD PAGE FILE

- An older company-page asset was gone from the current deployment; Pages returned the app HTML with HTTP 200 at its JavaScript URL. The preload handler and error boundary now share one guarded reload per minute, preserving the address and saved preferences. Offline and storage-restricted tabs offer manual recovery; persistent failures stop at a clear retry screen. Actual runtime errors retain their existing boundary.
- Authenticated HTML revalidates privately, missing `/assets/` files return 404 instead of SPA HTML, and signed-out asset requests return 401 so a recovery reload opens sign-in at the original page.
- Unit and middleware contracts cover classification, reload limits, blocked storage, cache policy and asset/auth responses. The built-app browser regression injects transient 404, persistent HTML/401, runtime exceptions and offline failures, and checks successful retry and address retention. CI runs these alongside the financial and table suites.

### Stage 10fv — RETURN ATTRIBUTION AND BENCHMARKS IN SUBTABS

- Morning CIO's Returns panel keeps the period controls and portfolio summary above two subtabs: Return attribution (default) and Benchmarks. Only the selected block is visible; switching preserves the attribution's grouping and expanded rows. `rview=benchmarks` supports direct links and browser history without changing the existing return parameters.
- The controls link to labelled panels, support arrow keys and Home/End, and keep one tab in the keyboard tab order. Existing page checks now verify the selected panel and summary placement, with a separate benchmark route and the existing financial checks retained.

### Stage 10fw — EVERY RETURN READS THE DATES BEHIND IT

*"We need to also make sure that we are accounting for all the dates to calculate the returns everywhere on the dashboard, so that the returns are logically correct."*

- **The audit:** account-level returns (Performance, Morning CIO, Family & Entities, Private Market, a fund's or mandate's own row) already solve over dated capital. Holdings did not. A lot-dated holding's CAGR compounded its whole return from the **oldest lot**: Crompton Greaves (₹9.88 L in Mar 2025, ₹5.59 L in Nov 2025) read −26.14% a year as if all of it were a year old. And per-holding XIRR was refused everywhere, though Stage 10fm's trades date every unit of 107 holdings.
- **`src/lib/holdingFlows.ts`** gives a holding its own dated money: each buy is money in on its day, each sale and dividend money out on its day, and the statement's value closes it on the statement's date. It applies only where the account's trades account for every unit held, or a lot register does and nothing was sold. The build now emits `BOOK_HOLDING_INCOME` (each dividend dated, tying to `dividendReceived`) and `BOOK_HOLDING_LOTS`.
- **`datedCapital.behind`** pools those flows for a row that is holdings rather than whole accounts (`RowCapital.holdings`). Every line must be dated in full, or the row keeps the per-holding answer. `measuredReturn` then applies the family's rule exactly as for an account: under a year HPR, several payments XIRR, one payment compounded from its own day. So a staggered holding's CAGR is refused and names XIRR (Crompton: XIRR −33.41%).
- **YTD:** `holdingPeriodOf` proves from the trades that a holding held nothing on 1 January. That gives 11 holdings opened this year a year-to-date return (their return since opening). One already held then names the date its units were first bought.
- **Every surface reads it:** Monitor rows, account lines and mandate shares, the company page's XIRR line, the Excel export and the consolidated audit sheet (whose purchase-date columns now use `investedOnOf`). The XIRR column's hover and the measure hints say holdings can carry a rate. `data-capital="holding"` marks these rows. An unverified HPR refuses every measure on such a row.
- **Checks:** `holdingFlows.test.ts` (test:family) ties the dividends to the holding's total, the lot cost to the statement cost, and the rule on all 111 dated holdings. The Excel and dated-capital suites move to the new rule and re-solve the 43 holding-level XIRR rows independently. `check:pages` gains `HOLDING_FLOWS_BOOK`, re-expressed off the book; the XIRR, CAGR and stock-page invariants read it; and new routes `monitor-xirr-security` / `monitor-cagr-security` put the PMS shares under the same claims.

### Stage 10fx — REMOVE THE PORTFOLIO RETURN SUMMARY CARD

- Removed the Portfolio return card, its window/coverage chips, calculation popup and five amount tiles from Morning CIO's Returns view. The toolbar now leads directly into Return attribution and Benchmarks. The benchmark portfolio comparison retains the same calculations and whole-account coverage gate.
- Removed unused card-only presentation code. Existing browser checks now assert that the summary stays absent, the subtabs follow the toolbar, and benchmark window/return checks still use the comparison tile. The period/type selection matrix follows the remaining controls instead of the removed popup.

### Stage 10fy — PRIVATE MARKET PROFILE FIELDS STAY OPEN FOR EDITING

- The family clarified that “live by default” means open text fields, rather than automatic public-source enrichment. Strategy and Description now start visible and editable within each investment row. Save/Cancel appears for a draft; failed saves retain it. Saved overrides can still be removed to reveal supplied text.
- Brand edits retain the existing exact investment keys and shared save endpoint. Aggregate rows keep their existing read-only resolution. Explicit column visibility choices, calculations, scrolling and sticky headers remain supported.
- Inline saves are serialized because each response carries its starting store snapshot plus the edit; overlapping replies must not hide another successful field. Focus reads wait for pending saves and cannot replace a newer edit.
- Existing profile/store suites verify identity and persistence contracts. The browser regression checks the default inputs, overlapping field saves and reopening the page, cancellation, a failed save and retry, removal, and a brand edit spanning several investments.

### Stage 10fz — VERIFIED STATEMENT PUBLICATION AND EXACT SOURCE ROWS

- Added the backend contract for the upload worker: isolate extraction/builds, verify owner/account/security and format/field coverage, compare individual reconciliation findings with the verified base, retain source receipts, seal artifacts and publish an atomic Git tree through a codex PR. CI/review and deployment verification remain explicit gates; intake never directly mutates production or clears staged files.
- The generated book retains the actual selected normalized holding pointer. Audit source links use it, and canonical data, per-field evidence and all reporting projections share one content-addressed revision. Quotes/NAVs retain independent instrument/value/time evidence. No dashboard layout changes.
- Added format-mutation, identity, duplicate, reconciliation, stale-artifact, atomic Git/retry and merge-gate tests, plus an actual-book/source-row contract. See `docs/STATEMENT-PUBLICATION.md` for the teammate's handoff and the precise evidence/format limitations.
